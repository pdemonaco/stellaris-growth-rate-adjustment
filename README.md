This mod provides a simple reduction of the long term empire growth rate penalty as the current value makes the late-game boring and annoying.

Specifically, by default growth of a new pop requires the following `100 + 0.5 * total_pops` growth points. This mod alters the per-pop multiplier to `0.05`.

It's also on [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=) for easier installing.
